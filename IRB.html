					<h3>Research Participant Information and Consent Sheet</h3>
					<p class = "help">Title of the Study: Explaining the Transboundary Trade in Hazardous Waste in North America
					<p class = "help">Principal Investigator: <a href="mailto:sarah.moore@wisc.edu">Sarah Moore</a>

					<h3>DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH</h3>
					<p class = "help">You are invited to participate in a research study about the hazardous waste trade in North America.
You have been asked to participate because you have some involvement with a site that imports hazardous waste into the United States.
The purpose of the research is to explore how individuals think about hazardous waste and what constitutes a successful hazardous waste management system.
The study will include people involved with managing the hazardous waste trade in North America.
Research will be conducted online. You will be given a unique link to the research tool and can use it in a location of your choice.

					<h3>WHAT WILL MY PARTICIPATION INVOLVE?</h3>
					<p class = "help">If you decide to participate in this research you will be asked to sort a set of statements into different columns based on how little or much they reflect the way you think about hazardous waste. After sorting the statements, you will be taken to a page asking you to provide more input on the six statements you feel are most worth commenting on or explaining.
Your participation will last approximately 25 minutes in total.

					<h3>WHAT WILL MY PARTICIPATION INVOLVE?</h3>
					<p class = "help">Risks include revealing sensitive or identifiable information about yourself or others in your explanations of the statements you comment on. To mitigate this risk, no personal, sensitive, or identifiable information about yourself or others will be included in any publications.
Risks also include the potential discussion of regulatory discrepancies concerning the hazardous waste trade in the statements you comment on. This study focuses on the licit hazardous waste trade, so any discrepancies revealed will not be included in this study, except to broadly recognize the boundaries of our analysis.

					<h3>ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO ME?</h3>
					<p class = "help">We don't expect any direct benefits to you from participation in this study.

					<h3>HOW WILL MY CONFIDENTIALITY BE PROTECTED?</h3>
					<p class = "help">While there will probably be publications as a result of this study, your name will not be used. Only group characteristics will be published.

						<h3>WHOM SHOULD I CONTACT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?</h3>
<p class = "help">You may ask any questions about the research at any time. If you have questions about the research after you leave today you should contact the Principal Investigator Sarah Moore at sarah.moore@wisc.edu.

<p class = "help">If you are not satisfied with response of research team, have more questions, or want to talk with someone about your rights as a research participant, you should contact the Education and Social/Behavioral Science IRB Office at 608-263-2320.

<p class = "help">Your participation is completely voluntary. If you decide not to participate or exit the survey without finishing, there will be no penalty.

<p class = "help">Your participation indicates that you have read this consent sheet, had an opportunity to ask any questions about your participation in this research and voluntarily consent to participate.
